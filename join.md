# Join us

Anyone can join the eslcc. The eslcc abides by the Hacker Ethics, which states that

> Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position.

However, a reasonably advanced understanding of computer technology is to be expected.

Please send an email to `join@eslcc.club`.
