On Tuesday, 9 May 2017, members of the eslcc met for the first time in person. This is what was discussed.

Vidminas told us the eslcc origin story. It all started with one chat message when I asked him to help me work on an Android app for SMS. Little did we know that this one message would start all this. We realised that the two of us (and, when he graduates, just me) wouldn't be able to cope with the load, so we had the idea of starting a group to work on such projects - and to learn in the process. And thus, eslcc was born.

>Pizza was had.

Next year, Vidminas will no longer be here, so I will take over leadership. We're considering using a system of "dual leadership", where there are always two leaders, one from a year below the other, so that when the elder leaves, the younger is ready to get to work immediately. However, it's too early to think about this, and this will probably be decided at the start of next year.

Somebody asked what our logo represents and where it came from. The answer: I made it because I thought it looks cool. It was supposed to be a placeholder until we can design something better, however we're geeks, not artists.

## The State of the Union

At the moment, we're primarily focusing on `euroschool-app`. We have some people working on it, learning React.js and React Native. Those with less experience have HTML/JS tasks for practice.

It's also worth noting that it's not just the leadership that decides the direction of the club. Any member can propose a project, and we can discuss it and maybe work on it.

And that's about it. Thanks to everyone who came out (and had pizza), and see you all in the next blog post.
