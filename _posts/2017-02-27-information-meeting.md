For everyone interested in joining the eslcc, we'll have an information meeting on Thursday 9 March, at 11:10, in room
F011. There we'll explain our aims with eslcc, what you can bring us, what we can bring you, and how to apply. Everyone
is welcome. If you can't make it to the meeting, we'll publish all the details on this website.

We hope to see you there!
