eslcc stands for European School Luxembourg Computer Club. The eslcc was founded by students who wanted to put their
advanced skills with computers to use. The eslcc's mission is as follows:

* Build an understanding of modern computer technology beyond the ICT syllabus
* Collaborate on personal projects to improve each otherâ€™s level of understanding and skill in practice, not just theory
* Work on real life technology related projects that benefit the whole school

If you wish to join the eslcc, please see the [Join Us](/join) page.

If you are from the school and have a project which you would like the assistance of the eslcc with,
 please email `marks [at] eslcc.club`.
